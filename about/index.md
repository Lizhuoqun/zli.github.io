I am a graduate student in the Computer Science Department at [Carnegie Mellon University](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/), where I am advised by [Andy
Pavlo](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~pavlo/). I am interested in database systems,
data management, and machine learning.

Before starting my graduate study at Carnegie Mellon University, I finished my Bachelor's degree in [Peking University](http://english.pku.edu.cn/),
majoring in Computer Science and Technology. In PKU, I used to work on data and information management with [Prof. Bin
Cui](http://net.pku.edu.cn/~cuibin/).
