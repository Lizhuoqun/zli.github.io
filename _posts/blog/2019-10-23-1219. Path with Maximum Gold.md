In a gold mine `grid` of size `m * n`, each cell in this mine has an integer representing the amount of gold in that cell, `0` if it is empty.

Return the maximum amount of gold you can collect under the conditions:

- Every time you are located in a cell you will collect all the gold in that cell.
- From your position you can walk one step to the left, right, up or down.
- You can't visit the same cell more than once.
- Never visit a cell with `0` gold.
- You can start and stop collecting gold from **any** position in the grid that has some gold.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: grid = [[0,6,0],[5,8,7],[0,9,0]]
Output: 24
Explanation:
[[0,6,0],
 [5,8,7],
 [0,9,0]]
Path to get the maximum gold, 9 -> 8 -> 7.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: grid = [[1,0,7],[2,0,6],[3,4,5],[0,3,0],[9,0,20]]
Output: 28
Explanation:
[[1,0,7],
 [2,0,6],
 [3,4,5],
 [0,3,0],
 [9,0,20]]
Path to get the maximum gold, 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= grid.length, grid[i].length <= 15`
- `0 <= grid[i][j] <= 100`
- There are at most **25** cells containing gold.



**Solution:**

Complete search with backtracking using DFS.

Note the direction trick.

Once any node is traversed, there is no need to start a new DFS on that node because it cannot exceed the current answer (with it being the )

```c++
int n,m;
int dir[5] = {0,1,0,-1,0};
vector<vector<int>> res;

class Solution {
public:
    int dfs(int x, int y, vector<vector<int>>& grid){
        int ans = 0;
        
        for(int i = 0; i<4;i++){
            int xx = x+dir[i];
            int yy = y+dir[i+1];
            if(xx>=0 && xx<n && yy>=0 && yy<m && grid[xx][yy]>0){
                int temp = grid[xx][yy];
                grid[xx][yy] = 0;
                ans = max(ans, temp+dfs(xx,yy,grid));
                grid[xx][yy] = temp;
            }
        }
        res[x][y] = ans;
        return ans;
    }
    int getMaximumGold(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
        n = grid.size();
        m = grid[0].size();
        res = vector<vector<int>>(n,vector<int>(m,0));
        int ans = 0;
        for(int i = 0;i < n;i++){
            for(int j = 0;j<m;j++){
                if(res[i][j]==0 && grid[i][j]>0){
                    int temp = grid[i][j];
                    grid[i][j] = 0;
                    ans = max(ans, temp+dfs(i,j,grid));
                    grid[i][j] = temp;
                }
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
```
