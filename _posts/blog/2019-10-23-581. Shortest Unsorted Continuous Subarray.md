Given an integer array, you need to find one **continuous subarray** that if you only sort this subarray in ascending order, then the whole array will be sorted in ascending order, too.

You need to find the **shortest** such subarray and output its length.

**Example 1:**

```c++
Input: [2, 6, 4, 8, 10, 9, 15]
Output: 5
Explanation: You need to sort [6, 4, 8, 10, 9] in ascending order to make the whole array sorted in ascending order.
```



**Note:**

1. Then length of the input array is in range [1, 10,000].
2. The input array may contain duplicates, so ascending order here means **<=**.



**Solution:**

Two pass, one from left and one from right.

On left, update the current max, any element that is less than current max is the left end of this subarray.

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int findUnsortedSubarray(vector<int>& nums) {
        int cmin = INT_MAX;
        int cmax = INT_MIN;
        int st = 1, nd = 0;
        int l = 0;
        int r = nums.size()-1;
        while(r>=0){
            if(nums[l] >= cmax){
                cmax = nums[l];
            }else{
                nd = l;
            }
            if(nums[r] <= cmin){
                cmin = nums[r];
            }else{
                st = r;
            }
            l++;
            r--;
        }
        return nd-st+1;
    }
};
```
