In an `n*n` grid, there is a snake that spans 2 cells and starts moving from the top left corner at `(0, 0)` and `(0, 1)`. The grid has empty cells represented by zeros and blocked cells represented by ones. The snake wants to reach the lower right corner at `(n-1, n-2)` and `(n-1, n-1)`.

In one move the snake can:

- Move one cell to the right if there are no blocked cells there. This move keeps the horizontal/vertical position of the snake as it is.
- Move down one cell if there are no blocked cells there. This move keeps the horizontal/vertical position of the snake as it is.
- Rotate clockwise if it's in a horizontal position and the two cells under it are both empty. In that case the snake moves from `(r, c)` and `(r, c+1)` to `(r, c)` and `(r+1, c)`.

- Rotate counterclockwise if it's in a vertical position and the two cells to its right are both empty. In that case the snake moves from `(r, c)` and `(r+1, c)` to `(r, c)` and `(r, c+1)`.

Return the minimum number of moves to reach the target.

If there is no way to reach the target, return `-1`.

 

**Example 1:**

**![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/09/24/image.png)**

```
Input: grid = [[0,0,0,0,0,1],
               [1,1,0,0,1,0],
               [0,0,0,0,1,1],
               [0,0,1,0,1,0],
               [0,1,1,0,0,0],
               [0,1,1,0,0,0]]
Output: 11
Explanation:
One possible solution is [right, right, rotate clockwise, right, down, down, down, down, rotate counterclockwise, right, down].
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: grid = [[0,0,1,1,1,1],
               [0,0,0,0,1,1],
               [1,1,0,0,0,1],
               [1,1,1,0,0,1],
               [1,1,1,0,0,1],
               [1,1,1,0,0,0]]
Output: 9
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `2 <= n <= 100`
- `0 <= grid[i][j] <= 1`
- It is guaranteed that the snake starts at empty cells.



**Solution:**

Djikstra. Postions as nodes, nodes connect if one postion can move to another position. Used a threshold to separate vertical and horizontal case.

```c++
int sep = 10000;
int INF = 1000000000;
int n;
class Solution {
public:
    bool valid(int x, int y, vector<vector<int>>& grid){
        return (x >= 0 && x<n && y>=0 && y<n && grid[x][y] == 0);
    }
    
    int minimumMoves(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
        n = grid.size();
        vector<int> dist(20001, INF);
        priority_queue<pair<int,int>> pq;

            pair<int,int> cur = pq.top();
            pq.pop();
            if(cur.first > dist[cur.second]) continue;
            int i = cur.second;
            dist[i] = cur.first;

                yh = (i-sep)%n;
                xt = xh-1;
                yt = yh;
                // cout<<xh<<" "<<yh<<" V:"<<dist[i];
                if(valid(xh,yh+1, grid) && valid(xt,yt+1,grid) && dist[i+1] > dist[i]+1) pq.push(make_pair(dist[i]+1,i+1));
                if(valid(xh+1,yh, grid) && dist[i+n] > dist[i]+1) pq.push(make_pair(dist[i]+1,i+n));
                if(valid(xt, yh+1, grid) && valid(xh,yh+1, grid) && dist[i-sep-n+1] > dist[i]+1) pq.push(make_pair(dist[i]+1,i-sep-n+1));
            }else{
                xh = i/n;
                yh = i%n;
                xt = xh;
                yt = yh-1;
                // cout<<xh<<" "<<yh<<" H:"<<dist[i];

                if(valid(xh,yh+1, grid) && dist[i+1] > dist[i]+1) pq.push(make_pair(dist[i]+1,i+1));
                if(valid(xh+1,yh, grid) && valid(xh+1, yt, grid) && dist[i+n] > dist[i]+1) pq.push(make_pair(dist[i]+1,i+n));
                if(valid(xt+1, yt, grid) && valid(xh+1, yh, grid) && dist[i+sep+n-1] > dist[i]+1) pq.push(make_pair(dist[i]+1,i+sep+n-1));
            }
            
        }
        return (dist[n*n-1] == INF)?-1:dist[n*n-1];
    }
};
