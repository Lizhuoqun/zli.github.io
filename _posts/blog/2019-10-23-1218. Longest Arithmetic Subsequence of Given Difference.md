Given an integer array `arr` and an integer `difference`, return the length of the longest subsequence in `arr` which is an arithmetic sequence such that the difference between adjacent elements in the subsequence equals `difference`.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: arr = [1,2,3,4], difference = 1
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest arithmetic subsequence is [1,2,3,4].
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: arr = [1,3,5,7], difference = 1
Output: 1
Explanation: The longest arithmetic subsequence is any single element.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: arr = [1,5,7,8,5,3,4,2,1], difference = -2
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest arithmetic subsequence is [7,5,3,1].
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= arr.length <= 10^5`
- `-10^4 <= arr[i], difference <= 10^4`



**Solution:**

Count the length of valid array that ends at position i: then cnt[num[i]] = cnt[num[i]-d]+1

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int longestSubsequence(vector<int>& arr, int diff) {
        unordered_map<int,int> pos;
        
        int ans = 1;
        
        for(int i : arr){
            pos[i] = max(pos[i],pos[i-diff]+1);
            ans = max(ans, pos[i]); 
        }
        
        return ans;
    }
};
```
