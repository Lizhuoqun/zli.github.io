Given a string `s`, a *k* *duplicate removal* consists of choosing `k` adjacent and equal letters from `s` and removing them causing the left and the right side of the deleted substring to concatenate together.

We repeatedly make `k` duplicate removals on `s` until we no longer can.

Return the final string after all such duplicate removals have been made.

It is guaranteed that the answer is unique.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "abcd", k = 2
Output: "abcd"
Explanation: There's nothing to delete.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "deeedbbcccbdaa", k = 3
Output: "aa"
Explanation: 
First delete "eee" and "ccc", get "ddbbbdaa"
Then delete "bbb", get "dddaa"
Finally delete "ddd", get "aa"
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: s = "pbbcggttciiippooaais", k = 2
Output: "ps"
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= s.length <= 10^5`
- `2 <= k <= 10^4`
- `s` only contains lower case English letters.



**Solution:**

Iterate from left to right, maintain a cound of how many consecutive chars we have at position i and a result string. Whenever the count reaches k we remove k elements.

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    string removeDuplicates(string s, int k) {
        string cur = "";        
        vector<int> dp(s.size()+1, 0);
        
        for(int i = 1; i<=s.size();i++){
            if(cur.empty()){
                cur += s[i-1];
                dp[i] = 1;
            }else{
                if(cur[cur.size()-1] == s[i-1]){
                    cur += s[i-1];
                    dp[cur.size()] = dp[cur.size()-1]+1;
                    if(dp[cur.size()] == k){
                        cur = cur.substr(0,cur.size()-k);
                    }
                }else{
                    cur += s[i-1];
                    dp[cur.size()] = 1;
                }
            }
            // cout<<cur<<" "<<dp[cur.size()]<<"\n";
        }
        return cur;
    }
};
```
