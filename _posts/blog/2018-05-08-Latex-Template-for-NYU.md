Recently, when I was working on my [capstone paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.09579) for my undergraduate degree at NYUAD, I felt obliged to follow NYU's [visual guideline](https://www.nyu.edu/employees/resources-and-services/media-and-communications/styleguide.html) when making my presentations and posters. It turned out easier than I thought to adopt NYU's color scheme. So I decided to make a template available to everyone at NYU. I have included styles for NYU, NYU Abu Dhabi and NYU Shanghai.

It is available at my [Github Repo](https://github.com/js8544/nyu-latex-templates)

## Acknowledgment
The poster template is based on the [Jacobs Landscape Poster](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/landscape-beamer-poster-template/vjpmsxxdvtqk) and the presentation template is based on the [Unofficial NEO UEA Template](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/unofficial-neo-uea-template/qvhndvzjqmqj).
