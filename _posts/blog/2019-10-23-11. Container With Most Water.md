Given *n* non-negative integers *a1*, *a2*, ..., *an* , where each represents a point at coordinate (*i*, *ai*). *n* vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of line *i* is at (*i*, *ai*) and (*i*, 0). Find two lines, which together with x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.

**Note:** You may not slant the container and *n* is at least 2.

The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49. 

 

**Example:**

```
Input: [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
Output: 49
```



**Solutions:**

Two pointers: the one with lower height moves inside.

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int maxArea(vector<int>& h) {
        int a = 0, b = h.size()-1;
        int ans = 0;
        while(b>a){
            ans = max(ans, min(h[a],h[b])*(b-a));
            if(h[a]<h[b]){
                a++;
            }
            else{
                b--;
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
```
