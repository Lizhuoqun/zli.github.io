I am an incoming MSCS student in the Computer Science Department at [Carnegie Mellon University](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/). As of current, I don't have a specific concentration. Before that, I am an undergraduate student at [New York University Abu Dhabi](https://nyuad.nyu.edu/en/) where I majored in mathematics and computer science. I am advised by [Dr. Sofiane Bouarroudj](https://nyuad.nyu.edu/en/academics/divisions/science/faculty/sofiane-bouarroudj.html) and [Dr. Dimitry Leites](http://staff.math.su.se/mleites/).

Being in a global Liberal Arts College, I was exposed to a variety of disciplines. I have studied Art History, Astronomy, Computer Science, Electrical and Computer Engineering, English Literature, Finance, Interactive Media, Mathematics (Pure and Applied) and Philosophy in college. I have studied in global campuses of NYU including Abu Dhabi, London, New York and Shanghai. I have interned as Financial Analyst, Research Assitant and Software Developer.  My current research interests include: Lie algebra and Lie superalgebras, Algebraic Geometry, Supersymmetry and Supermanifold, Internet of Things. For details please refer to my [Resume](/resume.pdf) and [Linkedin Profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jin-shang-49609710a/)

I believe I have a [Erd√∂s number](/erdos/) of 5.
