I am an MSCS student in the Computer Science Department at [Carnegie Mellon University](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/). Before that, I am an undergraduate student at [New York University Abu Dhabi](https://nyuad.nyu.edu/en/) where I majored in mathematics and computer science. I was advised by [Dr. Sofiane Bouarroudj](https://nyuad.nyu.edu/en/academics/divisions/science/faculty/sofiane-bouarroudj.html) and [Dr. Dimitry Leites](http://staff.math.su.se/mleites/).

Having studied in a global Liberal Arts College, I was exposed to a variety of disciplines. I have studied Art History, Astronomy, Computer Science, Electrical and Computer Engineering, English Literature, Finance, Interactive Media, Mathematics (Pure and Applied) and Philosophy in college. I have studied in global campuses of NYU including Abu Dhabi, London, New York and Shanghai. I have interned as Financial Analyst, Research Assitant and Software Developer. I believe that the variety of my academic and professional experiences is a unique treasure I can get nowhere else than NYU Abu Dhabi.
