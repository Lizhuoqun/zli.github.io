## About Me
I am a Ph.D. candidate at Louisiana State Universityï¼Œ under the guidance of Dr. Mingxuan Sun. My research encompasses machine learning, information retrieval, and data science, with a specialized focus on creating models for temporal point processes, reinforcement learning, and causality discovery. Central to my work is the development of innovative methodologies tackling high-impact challenges across diverse fields such as recommender systems, police operations, disaster rescue, healthcare, hotspot prediction, etc.
